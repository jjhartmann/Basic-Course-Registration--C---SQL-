Basic-Course-Registration--C---SQL-
===================================

This was one of my term projects for CMPT 354. 

It is simple mockup of a course registration system where a student can view, and register for courses. 
Depending on the current enrollment, the system will either enroll the student if enrolled < totalenrolled 
or place them in a wait list. 

Built using Viusal Studio C# and Microsoft Server SQL 2012.
